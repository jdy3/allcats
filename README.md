## Bonus points

- To build the 'best' functionality using the `'tag'` field, I would employ an _if statement_ on the _map function_ iterating through the API to check if the `'tag'` array contained the value 'best' and then add the badge as appropriate.

- For some delightful user interactions I would add some text highlighting and animation on hover and click states.

- I would use Jest for unit tests since I've used React.

- For accessibility I would add some ARIA labels.

- For loading / error / fail states / API issues, I would create some error pages to load to expalin this to the user.
